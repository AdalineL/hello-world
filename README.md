# hello-world
First GitHub project

This was made following [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial.

Terms:
  - Making a branch makes a copy of main
      - You can make edits to the branch and then merge it with main later 
      - It is similar to making different versions of a file (i.e. version-1.text, version-2.tct, etc)
  - Commits
      - Saved changes is a commit
      - Every commit has a commit message (a description of why the change was made)
