# hello-world
First GitHub project

This was made following [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial.

Terms:
  - Making a branch makes a copy of main
      - You can make edits to the branch and then merge it with main later 
      - It is similar to making different versions of a file (i.e. version-1.text, version-2.tct, etc)
  - Commits
      - Saved changes is a commit
      - Every commit has a commit message (a description of why the change was made)
  - Pull request
      - Propose your changes for someone to review and "pull in your contribution" and merge them into             their branch
      - "Pull requests show 'diffs', or differences, of the content from both branches"
            - "Changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red"
